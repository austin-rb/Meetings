# RTanque - A Game for Heroes

In today's episode, we'll be creating our own Ruby-powered tanks and pitting them together in all-out battle. May the best tank win!

## Getting started

Check out [the docs](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque) for the RTanque gem. Create a new project to house your tank:

```console
$ mkdir tank-battle; cd tank-battle
$ bundle init
$ echo "gem 'rtanque'" >> Gemfile
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rtanque new_bot my_deadly_bot
$ bundle exec rtanque start bots/my_deadly_bot sample_bots/keyboard sample_bots/camper:x2
```

**If you're having trouble installing RTanque on Mavericks, try using the system Ruby.**

## Building a better mousetrap... or tank, or whatever 

There are a few [sample bots](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque/tree/master/sample_bots) in the RTanque source to get you started. There are also [a couple listed in the wiki](https://github.com/awilliams/RTanque/wiki/bot-gists). These are likely your best source of inspiration, as reports are that the documentation is... lacking.

But lack of documentation has never stopped a Rubyist before! Remember that whole "Ruby is self-documenting" lie? Just pretend that it's 2008. *Have y'all ever used Merb? It's pretty rad.*

Of course, if you get hung up on anything, just ask for help! Your glorious leader for the evening has a wealth of experience helping get past coding roadblocks, and he's happy to share this expertise... or perhaps to secretly hobble your tank for his own benefit. MUA-HAHAHAHAAAAAA!

## Destroying your competition

Once you're successfully destroying inert tanks that can't defend themselves, it's time to move on to destroying ALL THE TANKS. Create a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) of the code for your tank, and past a link to the gist (along with your name) into [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xd5HE7Rg7cEEiVtE21zlYfCJIhZciFlAZ82nE3jn0z8/edit?usp=sharing).

As new entrants enter the arena, battles will play out on the big screen for all to behold.

## Socialization practice

After we've crowned a champion, we'll head over to Handlebar for a bit of post-Apocalyptic casual conversation.
